## Selecting-Best-model-and-Parameter.
#### The main Purpose of this project is to select best model.
Analysis and Model building has been done on the data earlier(check Machine Learning Tutorial)

#### Uses of Cross validation Score and GridSearchCv
What is the purpose of cross-validation in machine learning?

Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating ML models by training several ML models on subsets of the available input data and evaluating them on the complementary subset of the data.

What is the purpose of GridSearchCV in machine learning?

GridSearchCV tries all the combinations of the values passed in the dictionary and evaluates the model for each combination using the Cross-Validation method. which then retrurn the accuracy/loss for every combination of hyperparameters and we can choose the one with the best performance.
Both the Cross_val_score and the GridSearchCv are used in this notebook.
